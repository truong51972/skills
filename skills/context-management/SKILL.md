# Context Management

Manage reusable startup memory under `.agents/contexts/`. Keep it compact,
source-grounded, durable, and scoped to future work rather than the current
session.

## Activation and ownership

Apply this skill implicitly for non-trivial repository work when
`.agents/contexts/index.md` exists. Do not initialize context merely because the
skill is available. Use [init.md](references/init.md) only when the user requests
setup or repository instructions enable it.

Own only `.agents/contexts/`. Let source code, schemas, configuration, tests,
and canonical documentation own their exact details. Treat source as
authoritative whenever it conflicts with context.

## Lifecycle

1. Run **UNDERSTAND** before substantial work. Read
   [understand.md](references/understand.md).
2. Work against owning source files.
3. Run a scoped **SEMANTIC AUDIT** when context affects a decision, conflicts
   with source, references changed source roots, or the user requests review.
   Read [audit.md](references/audit.md).
4. Run **SYNC** only when durable repository knowledge changed. Read
   [sync.md](references/sync.md).
5. Run **MAINTENANCE** only for broad cleanup, routing problems, duplicate or
   oversized shards, large architecture changes, or explicit reset requests.
   Read [maintenance.md](references/maintenance.md).

## Storage test

Store a fact only when it is at least one of these:

- Durable across future tasks.
- Expensive to rediscover reliably.
- An important invariant, boundary, convention, or active assumption.

Do not store session summaries, task history, temporary TODOs, one-time test
results, or narration of recent edits. For exact API, task, schema, migration,
configuration, or implementation details, store a concise pointer to the
owning source instead of copying the detail.

## Loading rules

- Read `index.md` first.
- Load one shard at a time only when the current task needs it.
- Do not map a task category to a default bundle of several shards.
- Load `source-priority.md` only for ownership, canonical read order, source
  conflicts, or drift repair.
- Keep `index.md` limited to routing and loading policy.
- Add or split shards only when more targeted loading becomes useful.

## Compatibility

Interpret old `update` requests as **SYNC**. Fold routine `clear` cleanup into
**SYNC**; use **MAINTENANCE** for broad cleanup. Never reset, delete, or
reinitialize an existing context system without an explicit request.

## Helper CLI

Use the deterministic helper for structure and hygiene, not semantic proof:

```bash
python3 /path/to/context-management/scripts/context_ops.py init [repo-path]
python3 /path/to/context-management/scripts/context_ops.py lint [repo-path]
python3 /path/to/context-management/scripts/context_ops.py scan [repo-path]
python3 /path/to/context-management/scripts/context_ops.py validate [repo-path]
python3 /path/to/context-management/scripts/context_ops.py audit [repo-path]
python3 /path/to/context-management/scripts/context_ops.py audit --strict [repo-path]
python3 /path/to/context-management/scripts/context_ops.py status [repo-path]
```

Keep all existing commands compatible. Treat `scan` as the `lint` alias.
Treat `lint` as the hygiene gate and `validate` as the structure gate. Treat
`audit` as advisory: warnings return `0`, structural errors return `2`, and
`--strict` makes warnings return `1`.

Static drift findings are candidates only. Git activity, mtimes, link checks,
size, duplication, and identifier density do not establish semantic alignment.
All JSON output must retain `semantic_source_verification.status:
not_performed`.

## Completion

- Keep every shard reachable from `index.md` and lazy-loaded independently.
- Resolve conflicts in favor of source and sync only durable deltas.
- Run `lint` and `validate` after context edits; review `audit` findings.
- Report accepted warnings without claiming semantic verification.
